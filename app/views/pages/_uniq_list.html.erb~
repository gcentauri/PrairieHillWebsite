	<strong>FREEDOM</strong>
</p>
<p>
		<em>PRAIRIE HILL</em> is a safe environment, located 7 miles south of Lincoln on 12 acres of open space for children to explore. This country/farm setting provides children with a unique indoor/outdoor setting where they learn in the classroom and from nature.
</p>
<p>
		<strong>EXPERIENCED STAFF</strong>
</p>
<p>
				You won't find a staff more dedicated to the development of children anywhere. Each teacher is Montessori certified, and each assistant goes through a stringent training program, with many going on to gain their certification.
</p>
<p>
		<strong>MONTESSORI PHILOSOPHY</strong>
</p>
<p>
		<em>PRAIRIE HILL</em> is true to Montessori philosophy, offering children opportunities to engage in meaningful activities with the right balance of autonomy and guidance from specially trained teachers. Activities include hands-on science, geography, geometry, math, Suzuki piano and violin, and horsemanship.
</p>
<p>
		<strong>ELEMENTARY OPTION</strong>
</p>
<p>
		<em>PRAIRIE HILL</em> is the only school offering Montessori Elementary in the Lincoln area. Continuation of the education philosophy into the Elementary level maximizes the benefits of the child's primary-level experience from ages 3-6.
</p>
<p>
		<strong>NUTRITION</strong>
</p>
<p>
				Children help plan balanced menus and prepare nutritious food to share together, family-style. Seasonally they handpick cherries, apples, and garden vegetables, and gather eggs from the chickens. A variety of breads are freshly baked to enjoy at lunchtime. Food scraps are given to animals or composted.

          Children help plan balanced menus and prepare nutritious food to share together, family-style. Seasonally they handpick cherries, apples, and garden vegetables, and gather eggs from the chickens. A variety of breads are freshly baked to enjoy at lunchtime. Food scraps are given to animals or composted.

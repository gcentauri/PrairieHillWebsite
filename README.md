    <h2 class="camp-title">Survival and Awareness -- with BJ Spring</h2>
    <h3 class="camp-title">June 1-12</h3>
    <p class="camp-subtitle">
      One of PRAIRIE HILL's favorite camps (offered for a rare two-week session), campers will develop their skills in nature through fox-walking, building primitive shelters, awareness and sensory exercises, basket/rope making, and much more...
    </p>
    <h2 class="camp-title">What's the Story?</h2>
    <h3 class="camp-title">June 15 - 26<br>
    </h3>
    <p class="camp-subtitle">
      This two-week camp will be lead by storytellers and writers from various walks of life. Storytelling is a way to learn about culture, life &amp; death, growth, adventure, and moral dilemmas across space and time. Campers will hear engaging stories that weave together mythology, history, fiction and non-fiction. They will also have opportunities to write their own legends.
    </p>
    <h2 class="camp-title">Suzuki Violin Camp</h2>
    <h3 class="camp-title">July 6-10</h3>
    <p class="camp-subtitle">
      Suzuki violin players from ages 3-15 are welcome to come play in the prairie with us! Small group lessons will take place throughout the day from experienced violin instructors and tutors. Pony riding, gardening, and exploring on the farm are also a part of the experience. Half-day or full-day options are available for this session.
    </p>
    <h2 class="camp-title">Simple Machines and Complex Creations</h2>
    <h3 class="camp-title">July 13-24</h3>
    <p class="camp-subtitle">
      "Never give more to the mind than to the hand." is a quote that Maria Montessori used when writing about children. This session will give plenty of opportunities for the mind and the hand to work together to create and understand simple machines like the pulley, inclined plane, wheel-and-axel and more. There will also be opportunities to engage in creating unique art forms using these concepts and others. 
      <br>
    </p>
    <h2 class="camp-title">Animal Encounters</h2>
    <h3 class="camp-title">July 27-31</h3>
    <p class="camp-subtitle">
      This one-week science camp will be led by UNL professor, Eileen Hebets, who has headed up the Eight-legged Encounters event at Morrill Hall for the past several years. Children will observe and interact with a variety of animals during this camp, and will experience the scientific methods of questioning, observing, hypothesis, drawing conclusions, etc.
    </p>
    <h2 class="camp-title">Mini-camps for children ages 3-6</h2>
    <p class="camp-subtitle">
      Each two-week session consists of six wonder-filled days (Tuesday-Thursday, Tuesday-Thursday). Your child will enjoy a rich, natural PRAIRIE HILL experience through gardening, leisurely walks in the pasture, egg-gathering, pony rides, building shelters in the woods, singing, stories, and much more. A lunch from home will taste delicious in the shade of our picnic area!
